1. Maximum number of clients that can be handled at a time is
restricted to FD_SETSIZE.

2. Does not account for alphanumeric characters in the Content-Length header.

3. No individual timeouts. If a client does not send the rest of the header, server hangs.

4. Does not account for write short counts.

5. Bodies that have size over INT_MAX will crash the server.

6. if CGI generated body exceeds 8192 bytes, server will reject request.

7. Server crashes with a SEGFAULT when attempting to serve specific POST messages.

8. A particular corner case with pipelining causes the server to crash when servicing extremely large requests.

9. Built on a very tight deadline by a very sleepy person. May be prone to other bugs. Maybe lots.
